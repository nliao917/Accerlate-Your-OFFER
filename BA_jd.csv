And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

311,Business Analyst II,Vonage,"New Haven, CT","Vonage BI & Data Team Mission
We are a highly creative, energetic and results-oriented team that owns data and analytics delivery for the entire organization. This starts from data ingestion to corporate dashboards and includes data analytics to drive actions. The successful candidate is passionate about understanding customer needs, motivations, and behavior and enjoys discovering insights that help us deliver better outcomes like revenue growth, better customer experience, customer engagement and customer retention.

Why this role matters
As a Business Analyst, you will be helping us on a journey towards a modern, self-serve analytics organization. You will get autonomy and ownership around large parts of how we interface with users, how they’re trained and around defining the boundary between “let me show you how to do this yourself” and “let me do this for you”.
Over the last couple of years, we’ve made significant investments into our data infrastructure and our data processing platform. This has improved the internal team processes, however, there is still room for improvement on enabling self-serve and using advanced analytics techniques to predict what will happen rather than what happened.

What You Will Do
Work closely with Sales & Marketing on upgrading their suite of reports to move to a self-service reporting environment driving efficiencies and cost savings
Use data mining techniques and analyze core KPI's generating insight to reach and improve on the target goals
Assist in annual budget planning and alignment
Be our bridge and ambassador to the Sales & Marketing team, championing for self-service data analytics and maintaining relationships with power users
Be responsible for coordinating our user facing “Data Academy” education initiative to make sure our users can make the most of the data and reporting that we have
Work closely with the rest of the BI & Data team to help make sure the data engineering work being done is well aligned to stakeholder needs

We’re specifically not looking for someone to churn out reports for other people all day long.
Given the size of the team vs the hundreds of users we support, a large part of your work would be focused on finding ways to scale analytics via empowering our users so they are able to do what they are trying to do independently (while having support and training, if they need it).

Self-service analytics environment
We’re using a modern analytics stack with Tableau as the visualization front-end and Snowflake as the DWH, where the majority of report development is done by our users, we also use Python, SQL and Airflow
Rather than a report mill, the BI & Data team is there to empower and help users get their data and analytics work done themselves

What You Will Bring
We’re looking for an experienced analytics professional with practical experience implementing and scaling self-service analytics in a mid-sized organization.

What Is Required
Required: Bachelor’s Degree (preferably in Business, Economics, Statistics or Computer Science) and 5+ years of experience in data analytics role (preferably in a SaaS business)
Required: MBA or Master’s Degree (preferably in Financial Analytics, Data Science, Operations Research, Industrial Engineering or Computer Science)
Understanding of Sales & Marketing go to market motions, Campaign Performance measurement, and ROI measurement
Understanding and experience working with Salesforce CRM
Marketing or Sales background either through education or experience
Experience working independently with a wide range of stakeholders, from other analysts to senior management
Advanced knowledge of fundamental analytical, statistical techniques, attribution results, forecasting, simulation and data optimization
Strong technical capabilities with SQL, data warehouses, ETL processes, and data integration tools (Python, R coding/familiarity a plus)
Skilled in Tableau or other BI Tools

Bonus Points If You
Have experience driving self-service analytics adoption in a scalable way
Worked in an agile environment and were able to bring structure where there was none before

What’s In It For You
In addition to providing exciting work, career advancement opportunities, and a collaborative work environment, Vonage provides competitive pay and benefits including unlimited discretionary time off."

From API integrations and database structures to page layouts and built-from-scratch applications, you are an expert at digging in and understanding how systems work together. In business meetings you are the technical voice who can speak to the systems impact. In discussions with developers, you are the voice of the business advocating for your customer.

You play an integral, collaborative role in feature development, from business ask through user acceptance testing and deployment.

Expert in relationships! You’ve probably taken multiple personality assessments, know what Emotional Intelligence is, and pride yourself on your ability to build relationships based on mutual trust and respect.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills - the ability to talk and write with confidence, charisma and competence for a wide variety of audiences.
Detail-oriented. Okay we know it’s on about every job description – but we really mean it!

The Specifics.
You’ve got a minimum of 5-7 years’ Business Analyst experience working in an Agile environment.
Experience working with User Experience and Marketing teams for front-end web development
Experience with AB testing and experimentation platforms (Examples: Optimizely and/or Launch Darkly, etc.)
Whether it be homegrown IT systems or out-of-the-box software implementations, you’ve worked on systems that are used company-wide by lots of users.
Collaboration, collaboration and one more time, collaboration. You are an experienced liaison who can bring all stakeholders together and, more importantly, get them to agree.
Creating workflows, brainstorming use cases and coming up with clear, concise user stories are finely honed skills for you.
It’s in the job title. You’ve got solid analytical skills. Be it tables of data or end-user flows, you know how to analyze and organize.
Once you’ve analyzed and organized, you can create a compelling story with your excellent written and verbal skills.
You are a highly motivated self-starter who doesn’t need to be micromanaged. You think with a business owner mindset and are consistently anticipating business needs.

Creating workflows, brainstorming use cases and coming up with clear, concise user stories are finely honed skills for you.
It’s in the job title. You’ve got solid analytical skills. Be it tables of data or end-user flows, you know how to analyze and organize.
Once you’ve analyzed and organized, you can create a compelling story with your excellent written and verbal skills.

With over 25 years of industry experience, and our dedication to streamlining the purchase process, we're redefining what it means to buy and finance a used car.

At DriveTime, we do more than just sell used cars, we also offer warranties and ancillary products through SilverRock. SilverRock has issued over 700,000 service contracts, GAP products, and warranties and paid more than $300 million in claims… and not slowing down anytime soon!

That’s Nice, But What’s the Job?

The role of Business Analyst 2 takes on a different meaning in every company. Here at DriveTime, the emphasis is on enabling “Business” value through IT solutions. On a daily basis, you are responsible for eliciting requirements on updates and enhancements to DriveTime applications, but this role is so much more than requirements writing. From API integrations and database structures to page layouts and built-from-scratch applications, you are an expert at digging in and understanding how systems work together. In business meetings you are the technical voice who can speak to the systems impact. In discussions with developers, you are the voice of the business advocating for your customer. You really get the big picture and business goal, and are adept at translating that into the details needed for your team to make the goal a reality. You play an integral, collaborative role in feature development, from business ask through user acceptance testing and deployment.

Our IT Business Analyst responsibilities are to:
Work with Product Owners and end users to develop thorough requirements
Create concise and relevant project artifacts and build reports that tell a story
Work as a member of cross-functional teams to help design solutions
Develop user stories centered on the business value
Work with a team of developers to ensure requirements are met and provide insight during development

Assist in troubleshooting complex systems issues

So What Kind of Folks Are We Looking for?
Organization and time management skills in spades. You’ll be handling multiple projects and deadlines that will require you to prioritize then re-prioritize… then… re-prioritize again.
Expert in relationships! You’ve probably taken multiple personality assessments, know what Emotional Intelligence is, and pride yourself on your ability to build relationships based on mutual trust and respect.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills - the ability to talk and write with confidence, charisma and competence for a wide variety of audiences.
Detail-oriented. Okay we know it’s on about every job description – but we really mean it!

The Specifics.
You’ve got a minimum of 5-7 years’ Business Analyst experience working in an Agile environment.
Experience working with User Experience and Marketing teams for front-end web development
Experience with AB testing and experimentation platforms (Examples: Optimizely and/or Launch Darkly, etc.)
Whether it be homegrown IT systems or out-of-the-box software implementations, you’ve worked on systems that are used company-wide by lots of users.
Collaboration, collaboration and one more time, collaboration. You are an experienced liaison who can bring all stakeholders together and, more importantly, get them to agree.
Creating workflows, brainstorming use cases and coming up with clear, concise user stories are finely honed skills for you.
It’s in the job title. You’ve got solid analytical skills. Be it tables of data or end-user flows, you know how to analyze and organize.
Once you’ve analyzed and organized, you can create a compelling story with your excellent written and verbal skills.
You are a highly motivated self-starter who doesn’t need to be micromanaged. You think with a business owner mindset and are consistently anticipating business needs.

Nice to Haves.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

As such, the vaccine requirements of the Mandate and the Policy are currently on HOLD for U.S. employees, partners, and vendors.

The Business Analyst in the Office of Annual Giving (OAG) at Johns Hopkins University reports to the Director of Strategic and Divisional Priorities.
This is an opportunity to apply analytical and creative skills to the Office of Annual Giving (OAG) towards the goal of increasing annual giving dollars, donors, and pipeline across Johns Hopkins University & Medicine. The role is charged with using data and statistical analysis to unpack, better understand, and advance different facets of the Johns Hopkins annual giving ecosystem, including but not limited to: direct response, The Hopkins Fund, leadership annual giving, pipeline, and stewardship. The role is expected to leverage data mining, analysis, interpretation, and visualization using statistical and technical platforms like Python, R, and Tableau towards the goal of improving OAG efficiencies and the efficacy of annual giving strategies and tactics.
The Office of Annual Giving is a growing team that currently consists of fourteen colleagues who provide annual giving services to the nine schools of the university, various departments of Johns Hopkins Medicine, and several centers and institutes, totaling over 25 partners.

Like all offices and units in Development and Alumni Relations (DAR), OAG is committed to a donor-directed philanthropy philosophy.

Analyze OAG’s direct mail program to identify efficiencies and deficiencies in terms of ROI. Are their mailing segments that we should be discontinuing? Are their meaningfully ROI variances between the schools and units? If so, why. How do we maximize our ROI?
The effect of stewardship efforts on lybunts, sybunts, and long-lapsed donors. Are there discernable insights between schools and demographics?
Specific duties & responsibilities:
OAG is positioned and is expected to understand the giving behaviors for the base of support for approx. 25 school and units. This position is responsible for providing and at time finding useful data and analysis about the giving behaviors of Hopkins alumni and other donor populations in order for OAG to devise better strategy and tactics that yield stronger annual giving results.
Using statistical analysis, provide recommendations to maximize revenue for the flagship undergraduate annual fund, The Hopkins Fund, while optimizing donor count.
Boost direct response results through the creation and updating of annual giving dashboards for various internal development offices, providing details on revenue, donors, appeal response rate, ROI, and spatial trends. Train development office staff on how to use the dashboards, gaining feedback on improvements.
Track, assess, and make data-driven recommendation around the institutional-wide phonathon program as OAG contemplates the risks and opportunities of its calling program.
Provide data visualizations and data explanations to senior leadership and department leaders about opportunities to optimize fundraising efforts around dollars and donors.
Analyze data to monitor emerging pipeline initiative towards goal of identifying leadership annual giving prospects, as well as new major gift prospects.
Assess current data and workflow processes and make recommendations to design, redesign, and implement improvements to those business processes.

That’s Nice, But What’s the Job?

The role of Business Analyst 2 takes on a different meaning in every company. Here at DriveTime, the emphasis is on enabling “Business” value through IT solutions. On a daily basis, you are responsible for eliciting requirements on updates and enhancements to DriveTime applications, but this role is so much more than requirements writing. From API integrations and database structures to page layouts and built-from-scratch applications, you are an expert at digging in and understanding how systems work together. In business meetings you are the technical voice who can speak to the systems impact. In discussions with developers, you are the voice of the business advocating for your customer. You really get the big picture and business goal, and are adept at translating that into the details needed for your team to make the goal a reality. You play an integral, collaborative role in feature development, from business ask through user acceptance testing and deployment.

Our IT Business Analyst responsibilities are to:
Work with Product Owners and end users to develop thorough requirements
Create concise and relevant project artifacts and build reports that tell a story
Work as a member of cross-functional teams to help design solutions
Develop user stories centered on the business value
Work with a team of developers to ensure requirements are met and provide insight during development
Partner with QA on test plans/cases, perform UAT
Communicate with all levels of the organization (end users – sr. executive level)
Function as a subject matter, process, and operational expert for supported Product Line
Assist in troubleshooting complex systems issues

So What Kind of Folks Are We Looking for?
Organization and time management skills in spades. You’ll be handling multiple projects and deadlines that will require you to prioritize then re-prioritize… then… re-prioritize again.
Expert in relationships! You’ve probably taken multiple personality assessments, know what Emotional Intelligence is, and pride yourself on your ability to build relationships based on mutual trust and respect.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills - the ability to talk and write with confidence, charisma and competence for a wide variety of audiences.
Detail-oriented. Okay we know it’s on about every job description – but we really mean it!

The Specifics.
You’ve got a minimum of 5-7 years’ Business Analyst experience working in an Agile environment.
Experience working with User Experience and Marketing teams for front-end web development
Experience with AB testing and experimentation platforms (Examples: Optimizely and/or Launch Darkly, etc.)
Whether it be homegrown IT systems or out-of-the-box software implementations, you’ve worked on systems that are used company-wide by lots of users.
Collaboration, collaboration and one more time, collaboration. You are an experienced liaison who can bring all stakeholders together and, more importantly, get them to agree.
Creating workflows, brainstorming use cases and coming up with clear, concise user stories are finely honed skills for you.
It’s in the job title. You’ve got solid analytical skills. Be it tables of data or end-user flows, you know how to analyze and organize.
Once you’ve analyzed and organized, you can create a compelling story with your excellent written and verbal skills.
You are a highly motivated self-starter who doesn’t need to be micromanaged. You think with a business owner mindset and are consistently anticipating business needs.
