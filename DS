Unlike traditional workflow automation tools RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the applications graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI.
This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.
RPA tools have strong technical similarities to graphical user interface testing tools.
These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user.
RPA tools differ from such systems including features that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving email containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a bookkeeping system

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal.
You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake.
Today things are different.
The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes.
Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.

DS,"ENERGY INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION
The trillion dollar energy industry is undergoing a disruptive transformation.
Energy generation is going from centralized to decentralized.
Utilities are shifting from vertically integrated power producers and distributors (think PG&E; SoCal Edison) to nimbler energy services providers operating in increasingly deregulated environments.
New generation assets are smaller in scale, distributed, powered through renewable sources, and owned by the customers.
This shift will lead to over $10 Trillion in new energy investments by 2040.
With this dramatic change, energy providers must run their business in new ways.
Energy providers of the future will be data-driven, where effective use of data will determine who wins and who loses.
