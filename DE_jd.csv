Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.

258,Data Engineer,Cheetah,San Francisco Bay Area,"About Cheetah

Restaurants and small businesses account for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual purchasing, yet most of it happens offline. From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a series of truck deliveries.

With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah’s services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. Partnering with the largest suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing the Silicon Valley user experience to an industry that hasn’t evolved in decades. In the process, we’re helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small farmer, global supply chains to familiar faces, and delivery and logistics workers to increased mobility and new opportunities.

At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with deep industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $130M in funding from Eclipse, Floodgate, Manna Tree, Sator Grove, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb.

Unencumbered by the old-school business models and practices, Cheetah has introduced unprecedented transparency in pricing and inventory to the SMB marketplace. In doing so, Cheetah allows the people who form the backbone of local economies to focus on what they love: cooking great food and providing excellent service. From the convenience of their phones, business owners can now order whatever they need, discover new, rare or seasonal specialty products, and prioritize their customers. No more rushing to unload your double-parked van, or waiting anxiously for a truck to show up with your weekly allotment of boxes.

341,Data Engineer,Amazon,"Herndon, VA","Description

Come join a security team who focuses on ease of use and delighting our customers to build security services, used across all of Amazon, that secure our internal systems and networks.

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), Security is our highest priority. Our team is responsible for inventing, scaling, and operating the foundational security services used across Amazon to secure our systems, processes, and data. We build authentication, authorization, and enforcement services that are used across our diverse internal teams as they build and deliver services for our customers. We support all of Amazon.com and AWS with our services, and need solution-oriented thinkers who are passionate about solving problems at scale, thinking through edge cases, and iterating quickly to delight our customers.

Are you a good fit for our team?

You’ll love this team if you are passionate about security, and curious how we design security into the cloud and Amazon infrastructure from the minute a server hits our data center through how we securely administer and operate services. At Amazon, we are looking for engineers who know how to think through a problem, be creative, and who think outside the box in ways that benefit our customers. The intense focus we have on our customers is why we are one of the world’s most beloved brands – it is part of our company DNA. Our Engineers (you!) are obsessed with customer trust, building solutions that address real world risks, and thinking deeply about how humans use security systems to build elegant security that users love to use. We are looking for people who bring diverse perspectives, ask a lot of questions, and challenge the status quo. We are a team of out-of-the-box thinkers, who iterate quickly, and think deeply about how to build secure systems that are easy to use.

Team Culture

We work across the company on services that are always-on; the company depends on us. To perform our best, we value work/life harmony, flexible schedules, and unscheduled time to brain storm. We support established, and rapidly growing services, with a DevOps model, so you will be part of an oncall rotation every couple of months. Our challenges and goals are ambitious, often ambiguous, and we sometimes try things that don’t work. We embrace the learnings from failure and iterate quickly. We emphasize shipping rapidly, using automated releases and testing to deploy frequently, and deeply root causing issues to ensure that we stay fast. Almost all of our team works from home these days, but typically we are together in the office collaborating around a whiteboard, planning over coffee, or playing a video game during downtime.

What you would do

In this role you will join an established and rapidly growing DevOps software team who is maintaining an existing security service while expanding the deployment, features, and capabilities to address significant new initiatives across the company. We are looking for Data Engineers with expertise to help us design, build, and maintain performant, big data solutions that scale to meet the needs of our customers.

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.
